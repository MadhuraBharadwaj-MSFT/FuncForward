Over the past year, we've driven several feature retirements and upgrades like language versions, bundles, host versions. We also have other dimensions like programming model for Python and Node, Linux Consumption SKU. At a Functions team level we have a KPI to get at least 90% of customers to supported versions. We have warnings, errors logs, detectors, email notifications in place to inform the customer that their app is in an unsupported state - and this awareness did help move the needle on getting customers off of unsupported versions. But its still not at 90%. To close this gap, we need to go beyond awareness and make it significantly easier for customers to understand the right upgrade path, reduce decision friction, and take action.
